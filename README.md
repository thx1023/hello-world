learning is fun-duh-mental

THX1023 is a hybrid nerd, an altruist, a cook, brother, uncle, surrogate father, and certifiable nutjob, as evidenced by his list of other traits.  He has more energy than he should and lacks the reasonable type of fear that most people enjoy.  Pity him, but don't let him see you.  He'll just try to make you feel better, and we all know how annoying that is...
