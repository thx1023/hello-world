learning is fun-duh-mental

THX1023 is a hybrid nerd, an altruist, a cook, brother, uncle, surrogate father, addicted to anyone learning anything, and certifiable nutjob, as evidenced by his list of other traits.  He has more energy than he should and lacks the reasonable type of fear that most people enjoy.  He finds literally everything interesting.  Yes, he knows what literally means.  Pity him, but don't let him see you.  He'll just try to make you feel better, and we all know how annoying that is...
